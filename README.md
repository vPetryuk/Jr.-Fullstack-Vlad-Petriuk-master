# Adverity Full-stack challenge

Hi! It's nice to see you here and all the best luck solving the challenge!
It based on simplified version of one of the day-to-day tasks we encounter at Adverity. 

To make the coding more pleasant for you, we've taken care of basic app bootstrap, please see `docker-compose.yaml` for details.
Feel free to use different setup, add additional packages, libraries, images as you wish.

We're interested in a clean solution for the problems described in the requirements list. Besides that, we'd be looking at your whole approach to applications development: performance, code & file structure, architecture & API design, etc.

The task is supposed to take around 8 hours to complete. Do not hesitate to prioritize functionality and/or adjust the complexity of your solution. We expect you to cover all the requirements. We'd ask you to complete the challenge within 14 days. Should that not work for you (vacation/workload/other obligations - life happens, right?), please inform our recruiter, and we'll find a tailor-made solution.

Please publish your solution as a github repository and send us a link.

## Running the app
In order to start the example application please use `docker-compose up` and visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

As we like Docker and simplicity, it would be great if your solution could be started with the same `docker-compose up`.

However, if you chose not to use Docker or running your app requires extra steps like running scripts, installing extra dependencies etc. please make sure to include clear instructions and requirements. **Please keep it as simple as possible.**

## App requirements

We would like you to create a simple application that would allow the users to upload, enrich and preview `.csv` files. 
The requirements are kept simple but please feel free to extend them and show us your skill as you please. 
You are given a freedom in structuring the UI and the number of views you develop - we love creativity!

---
### Requirement #1

*As a user I need to upload `.csv` file and be able to preview its content in a table*

Please use `users_posts_audience.csv` file for testing, it contains users' posts views data

### Requirement #2

*As a user I would like to see the list of all files I've uploaded, so I can choose the file I want to preview*

### Requirement #3

*As a user I would like to enrich my data file with additional details fetched from API endpoint*

- User should be able to input API endpoint for fetching external data, you can use following endpoints for testing:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/
- User should be able to select key column name from data file that would be used for joining data, by default first column should be pre-selected
- User should be able to input key name for API response that would be used for the other side of join
- Based on selected keys, enriching should add all keys from the API response for each matching row as new columns  
- Enriching existing file should create a new file accessible in the listing from **Requirement #2**, original file should not be modified

## Extra hints
- We've prepared a basic setup including Django, Celery, Postgres and Redis but feel free to use different stack that you are more familiar with
- We encourage you to use a frontend framework of your choice, i.e. React, Vue
